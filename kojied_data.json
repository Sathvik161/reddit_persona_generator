I could use Mac virtual display, but since I have a M1 MBP the latency is noticeable to the point it’s an adverse experience. I already dropped $4k on this device, renewing my MBP just so I can use it with my AVP is asking a bit too much…\nAlso where’s Xcode? If Apple wants AVP to be a “work device”, they gotta have at least Xcode right?\nI can get the simple stuff like emails done through AVP, but if this device can’t replace my entire workflow, I don’t know if I can justify the price. I’m sure it’ll get resolved down the line (more of a software issue than hardware constraints), but curious to hear how realistic it is for people to port over their workflow to AVP, and what apps you’d like to see ASAP."

Which is why the west, led by the US, has been trying to cause instability, and destroy historical artifacts. That way, the true history of how the WG came to be won’t come into light. Like, archaeology is basically using artifacts discovered and interpreting it a certain way. The whole concept is something that mostly grew into a concept in the UK around 1824. 1824 is the year the Oxford English Dictionary defined \"archaeology\" a word.\n(Btw our generation will be remembered for our new additions which include anti-work, curry laksa, diet-busting, final frontier, fugazi, gajillion, skellington, straight-talking, stonkingly, voguing,etc.)\nBack to the main topic, what I’m saying is that it’s pretty easy for the “1%” to control the “story of our world” through archeologists and historians. These have traditionally been an activity for the rich and remains that way. Like, who tries to become a historian unless they have trust funds?\nSo yeah, maybe the history we are told on a daily basis is pretty different from reality, and Oda is trying to tell us this message.\nWhat are pacifistas? They're our modern comparable to AI. They will be the ultimate, infinite, obedient, power between the celestial dragons (also known as the 1%) and us normal humans.\nSo who is our Nika? Who is our Joy Boy? are we too early to hear the drums of liberation, or do we actually all have our own drums of liberation?\n\n"

Sure it has developed new investing policies and has made some impact from the shareholder side, but as someone who's worked in environmental consulting, I felt that we needed a more direct way of getting ESG ratings into the mass conscience.\nDo you think individuals should be aware of our own ESG rating?\nI feel that companies would take ESG ratings  seriously if consumers changed their purchase behaviors based on the score.\nThe current method of consumer activism has yielded lackluster results. This is because once the news dies down, consumers forget about the scandal and go back to normal purchasing behavior. In addition, companies aren't really incentivized to make changes, since consumers hear about the scandal, but rarely stay informed about what was done about it.\nThe first step towards voting with our dollars is to be aware of our current ESG impact. This can be approximated through the ESG score of the companies you are purchasing goods/services from, multiplied by the dollar amount of your purchase.Sustainalyticshas a comprehensive ESG rating for most public companies. For purchases from businesses that are private (and doesn't have any ESG rating), we can approximate from comparable public companies, or use other indicators (BCorp, Fair Trade, etc.)\nPlease let me know what you think!\nIndividual ESG scores could elevate sustainable conscience to another level, which would lead to climate activism on a larger scale."

But is there a way to better understand what we get our \"gratification\" from, and track this?\nMy initial idea was an app that would enable users to track the \"gratification\" they receive from their purchases. If you regret what you bought, you can record a decline in the gratification, or if you found the purchase better than you expected, you can record an increase.\nOf course, this would not necessarily apply to all purchases. Some things (rent, insurance, etc.) do not yield any gratification scores, but many purchases (clothes, going out, etc.) could.\n\nWould love to hear how you make your purchase decisions, and if there's a mental model you follow!\n(photo is a mockup of the idea I'm working on)"

High quantity stuff is easy to stock, and you could have multiple trading posts up without any major issues. The exact opposite of this is plate armor. It takes forever to build, requires three points, and needs eight iron slabs to make it. It’s cheaper to just export the ore, and since it’s a low quantity trade, it’s hard to stick multiple trade posts with it"

            "comment_text": "- the hype has definitely faded, you can see that with the price as well as the number of people discussing it on X, or even here- haven't seen much innovation in the space at all, the momentum seems to have shifted to solana memecoins, and dissipated after that- again, people no longer seem interested. I found linksDAO to be an interesting concept of fractionally owning a golf course, and they're still active but not much hype around them anymore either. Most major brand NFT collaborations have died down as well- the NFT craze has not settled into something sustainable, it's dead. Can it come back? Possibly, it has happened before, when cryptopunks and cryptokitties were first hot in 2017-ish, then died, then came back during 2020-2022.- will there be a big boom? I personally don't think it would in the way we think of NFTs as collectables. A major thesis was around digital scarcity, and that seemed possible during covid, but post covid people went back to f2f interactions. Digital scarcity could become a hot topic again if we see a broader adoption of VR or even XR, but that seems a bit down the line. I think fractional ownership of assets could be interesting, but they'd just be fungible tokens, not NFT\nI see so many one-off posts on this community with only a couple responses. Can't believe there's 2.7M members here. That alone should tell you that NFTs are no longer something people are interested in. I'd love to be proven wrong, since I feel that there was alot of potential, but so far it seems like the community is dead"
